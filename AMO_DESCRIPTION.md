# TST Tree Sorter

**Organize your Tree Style Tab sidebar with powerful, flexible sorting.**

**TST Tree Sorter** integrates seamlessly with [Tree Style Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab) to help you tame your chaotic tab trees. Whether you have 10 tabs or 1000, keep them perfectly organized by **Title**, **URL**, **Domain**, or **Access Time**.

## Key Features

*   **Sort by Title**: Alphabetical sorting (A-Z, Z-A) with locale-aware support.
*   **Sort by URL**: Group tabs by hostname and path.
*   **Sort by Domain**: Smartly groups tabs by base domain (e.g., keeping `google.com` and `google.co.uk` separate or together).
*   **Sort by Last Accessed**: Find your most recently used tabs instantly.
*   **Deep Sorting**: Recursively sort entire sub-trees or just immediate children.
*   **Global Sort**: Organize your entire sidebar (top-level tabs) with one click.
*   **Multi-Selection Support**: Sort multiple selected branches at once.
*   **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Bind custom shortcuts for quick sorting actions.
*   **Theme-Responsive**: The icon automatically adapts to light and dark themes.

## Usage

1.  Right-click on any tab in the Tree Style Tab sidebar.
2.  Navigate to the **Sort Tree** menu.
3.  Choose your criterion (**Title**, **URL**, **Domain**, **Time**) and direction.

That's it! Your tabs are reorganized instantly.

## Safety First

*   **No Data Collection**: This extension does not collect or transmit **any** user data.
*   **Undo Protection**: Large sorts (>50 tabs) prompt for confirmation to prevent accidents.
*   **State Preservation**: Keeps your tabs' collapsed/expanded states, audio status, and hierarchy intact.

## Permissions Explained

*   **Access browser tabs**: Required to read titles/URLs for sorting.
*   **Store unlimited amount of client-side data**: Used to save your extension preferences locally.
*   **Display notifications**: Shows success/error messages for long-running sorts.
